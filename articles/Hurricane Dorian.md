Parts of the Bahamas were wiped out as Hurricane Dorian lashed the country’s northern Grand Bahama and Abaco Islands this week.

Aerial images taken on Tuesday over Marsh Harbour, the largest town on Great Abaco Island, give a first look at the large-scale damage there.

The Leonard M. Thompson International Airport on Great Abaco was completely inundated with floodwaters on Tuesday, inhibiting rescue missions.

Two neighborhoods of makeshift houses that are home to many Haitian immigrants appeared reduced to piles of plywood and rubble.

In smaller offshore islands like this one, the storm ripped the roofs off some houses and flattened others.

The area near the Hope Town lighthouse on Elbow Cay, a small island to Great Abaco’s east, also suffered damage.

An analysis by Descartes Labs of radar data captured Wednesday revealed widespread flooding across several more islands, including Grand Bahama. The flooding damaged homes and roads in Freeport, the island’s main city and the site of its airport, hampering rescue and recovery efforts.
